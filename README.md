React Router Dog Finder
Build an app that allows a user to browse dogs.

At the top of the app, add a navbar that displays the current active route.

The app should have the following routes:
<ul>
  <li>/dogs is the homepage and shows all three dogs</li>
<li>When youâ€™re on the homepage, you can click on a dog to view more information on that dog. Each dog should have its own unique route. For example, clicking on Whiskey will take you to /dogs/whiskey.</li>
<li>Every other endpoint not listed should redirect you to /dogs.</li>
<li>Make the website responsive (if you have time). The solution uses bootstrap to add a responsive navbar and grid layout.</li>
